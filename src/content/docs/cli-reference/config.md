description: Every key in .winter/config.toml and the .winter/config.local.toml overlay — types, defaults, and behavior.
---

Winter reads two files and merges them: the committed workspace config and a gitignored per-user overlay.

- `.winter/config.toml` — the committed workspace config (repo list, excludes, defaults).
- `.winter/config.local.toml` — a gitignored overlay for per-user settings. It uses the same schema and overrides the shared config key by key.

## Top-level keys

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `main_branch` | string | `"main"` | Workspace-default main branch. Each `[[project_repository]]` may override it. |
| `session_prefix` | string | — | tmux session prefix used by the service-orchestration extension. |
| `adopt_extensions` | string | `"winter"` | How aggressively standalone repos contribute skills/agents: `winter`, `all`, or `none` (see below). |
| `doctor` | string (path) | — | Optional workspace-level `winter doctor` probe script, relative to the workspace root, must be executable. |
| `lint` | string (path) | — | Optional workspace-level `winter lint` check script, relative to the workspace root, must be executable. |
| `service_orchestrator` | string | — | Extension name that handles `winter service` dispatch. Must match a `[[standalone_repository]]` that ships a `winter-ext.toml` with an `orchestrate_services` key (see [Service orchestration](#service-orchestration)). |
| `git_excludes` | string[] | `[]` | Entries appended to every repo's `.git/info/exclude` on `winter ws init`. |

### `adopt_extensions` modes

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `winter` (default) | Process only standalone repos that have a `winter-ext.toml`. SKILL.md frontmatter is strictly validated. |
| `all` | Process any standalone repo with a `skills/`, `agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, or `.claude/agents/` directory, manifest or not. Frontmatter validation downgrades from refuse to warn. |
| `none` | Skip extension processing entirely. Standalone repos are still cloned; no symlinks are created. |

## `[[project_repository]]`

Repos cloned into `projects/` and worktreed into Greek-letter environment directories. Entries appear in CLI/TUI output in declared order, so list high-priority repos first.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `url` | string | — (required) | Clone URL. |
| `name` | string | trailing path segment of `url`, `.git` stripped | Directory under `projects/` and the user-facing label everywhere. |
| `main_branch` | string | top-level `main_branch` | Per-repo override of the main branch. |
| `cmd` | string[] | `[]` | Commands run after clone and in every worktree (e.g. `["pnpm install"]`). |
| `pinned` | bool | `false` | Track `origin/<main>`, skip feature branching, exclude from `push` by default. |
| `git_excludes` | string[] | `[]` | Per-repo excludes, merged with the workspace-wide list. |

```toml
[[project_repository]]
name = "app-web"
url = "git@github.com:org/app-web.git"
cmd = ["pnpm install"]

[[project_repository]]
name = "shared-tools"
url = "git@github.com:org/shared-tools.git"
pinned = true
```

## `[[standalone_repository]]`

Repos cloned at the workspace root (or a configured `path`), with no worktree and no feature branching. Used for winter extensions and auxiliary repos.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `url` | string | — (required) | Clone URL. |
| `name` | string | derived from `url` | Repo name; default clone directory. |
| `path` | string | `name` | Clone location, relative to the workspace root. |
| `prefix` | string | from `winter-ext.toml`/name | Symlink-prefix override for an extension's skills/agents. |

```toml
[[standalone_repository]]
name = "winter-service-tmux"
url = "git@github.com:paul-gross/winter-service-tmux.git"
path = ".winter/ext/service-tmux"
```

## `[keybindings]`

Remaps the `winter dashboard` keys. Every built-in (and plugin) dashboard action has a stable *action id*; an id with no entry keeps its default.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `leader` | string | `"\\"` | Key spec that `<leader>` expands to. |
| `timeoutlen` | integer | `1000` | Milliseconds to wait for the next key of a chord sequence (Neovim's `timeoutlen`). |

Action-id → key-spec entries live in the `[keybindings.bindings]` sub-table, with quoted ids so a dotted id stays a flat key. Specs are Neovim-inspired — single keys, modifier chords (`<C-s>`), `<leader>` expansion, and multi-key sequences (`gd`, `<leader>S`):

```toml
[keybindings]
timeoutlen = 400

[keybindings.bindings]
"workspace.refresh" = "<C-r>"
"worktree.open_detail" = "o"
"plugin.codediff" = "<leader>d"
```

The full action-id list and key-spec grammar are in the canonical reference below.

## Local overlay (`.winter/config.local.toml`)

Same schema as the shared config; keys override key by key. Most commonly it carries your git identity, which winter applies to every repo it manages during `winter ws init`:

```toml
[git]
user.name = "Jane Doe"
user.email = "jane@example.com"
```

You can also declare additional `[[project_repository]]` / `[[standalone_repository]]` entries here that you don't want committed to the shared config.

## Implicit workspace repo

The `workspace` repo is discovered implicitly — it is not declared in either file. Winter detects it from the filesystem as the repo the CLI is invoked from.

## Service orchestration

`winter service` owns a stable `up`/`down`/`status`/`restart`/`logs` interface and dispatches each call to a single orchestrator extension the workspace registers. Two distinctly-named keys connect the interface to an implementation:

- **`service_orchestrator`** (top-level in `.winter/config.toml` or the local overlay) — the name of an installed extension. Must match a `[[standalone_repository]]` entry that ships a `winter-ext.toml`.
- **`orchestrate_services`** (in that extension's `winter-ext.toml`) — an executable entrypoint path, relative to the extension's repo root.

```toml
# .winter/config.toml
service_orchestrator = "winter-service-tmux"

# .winter/ext/service-tmux/winter-ext.toml  (inside the extension repo)
orchestrate_services = "workflow/service"
```

With both keys in place, `winter service <action> <env>` resolves the orchestrator and runs its entrypoint. When either is missing — no `service_orchestrator` in config.toml, a name matching no installed extension, or an extension without an `orchestrate_services` key in winter-ext.toml — the command fails and names the specific gap. Only one orchestrator is supported; there is no per-env selection.

The full implementer-facing contract (uniform argv rule, `WINTER_*` env vars per action, NDJSON wire format for `logs`, idempotent backstop filters, and exit codes) lives in the canonical reference — see [`ai/winter-cli/usage.md#orchestrator-contract`](https://github.com/paul-gross/winter/blob/master/ai/winter-cli/usage.md#orchestrator-contract).

## Extension manifests

Per-extension configuration lives in each extension's own `winter-ext.toml`, not in `config.toml`. See the [Extensions](/winter-docs/extensions/) guides.

Key fields in `winter-ext.toml`:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `name` | Default symlink prefix when no override is set. |
| `prefix` | Optional shorter prefix; takes precedence over `name`. |
| `skills_dir` / `agents_dir` | Explicit paths; override default discovery. |
| `doctor` | Executable emitting NDJSON probe events for `winter doctor`. |
| `lint` | Executable(s) emitting NDJSON findings for `winter lint` (string or list). |
| `orchestrate_services` | Executable entrypoint path for `winter service` dispatch (see [Service orchestration](#service-orchestration)). |
| `requires` | Other module names this one depends on; consumed by `winter graph`. |
